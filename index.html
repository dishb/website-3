            I&apos;m a high-school student with a passion for soccer and coding. Ever since I was a kid, I was
            building things with LEGOs, now, I build software. I&apos;m responsible and driven. I can also
            communicate on time and clearly while successfully working in a team. My favorite sport, soccer, 
            helps reinforce my importance of discipline and teamwork.

            <span class = "project"><a href = "https://github.com/dishb/monstera">monstera</a></span>
            - Monstera is a command-line-tool (CLI) that I wrote purely in my favorite language, Python. This was my first original
            project that I&apos;d made. I came up with the idea after looking through GitHub issues on one of my favorite 
            Python packages, customtkinter. The issue I saw was that whenever someone created an issue in the GitHub 
            repository, they would forget to include important details like their version of the package or their 
            operating system. Often, these issues were solved in the latest release, which they were not using. Monstera 
            aims to solving this issue by making all of this information easily accessible. Just run one command in your terminal!
            With GitHub's issue templates, project maintainers can ask people to copy and paste the output of monstera.
            <br /> <br />
            <span class = "project"><a href = "https://github.com/dishb/firestarter">firestarter</a></span>
            - Firestarter is another command-line-tool (CLI) written in only Python. I continued my little "trend" of programming CLIs 
            in Python after monstera. At the time, I had been learning web development with ReactJS and had been using ViteJS as my
            development tool. I liked how ViteJS helped developers quickly start new web development projects by creating the
            boilerplate files and scaffolding necessary. I wanted to bring this functionality to the Python ecosystem. So, I created 
            firestarter. I even wrote a small, custom language for firestarter called fuel that allows you to setup a project without manually
            answering all the basic questions the CLI asks. The project isn&apos;t as featured as ViteJS because I haven&apos;t worked on it for as 
            long as the ViteJS devs and some features (like live servers) aren't necessary.

            <span class = "project"><a href = "https://github.com/dishb/recycle-it">recycle-it</a></span>
            - RecycleIT was a project I made at my first 24-hour hackathon. I participated in a hackathon in my city with a partner whom I&apos;d met online. 
            The theme given to us was wheels in a cog. The organizers of the competition explained that this theme referred to people within society 
            whose jobs/roles usually go unnoticed. We decided to focus our project on municipal utilities, specifically, garbage. Our project is a 
            desktop application that uses AI to analyze an image and decide whether the object should be recycled, trashed, or composted. We used Python, 
            customtkinter, and a free API (AI waste classification) to built the application. The project was a great learning experience for me and 
            allowed me to meet new people while stepping outside of my comfort zone.
